## Cairn 2e Player's Guide
Cairn is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly.

## Overview
Cairn was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

- **Neutrality**: The Warden's role is to act as a neutral arbiter and portray the rules, situations, non-player characters (NPCs), and narrative clearly.
- **Classless**: A character's role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.
- **Death**: Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.
- **Fiction First**: Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are based on in-world elements and arbitrated by the Warden in dialogue with the players.
- **Growth**: Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.
- **Player Choice**: Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.
- **Principles**: The Warden and the players each have guidelines that help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.
- **Shared Objectives**: Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Players
- **Agency**
    - Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
    - Don't ask only what your character would do; ask what you would do, too.
    - Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.
- **Teamwork**
    - Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
    - Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.
- **Exploration**
    - Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
    - Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
    - There is no single correct way forward.
- **Talking**
    - Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
    - You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.
- **Caution**
    - Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
    - Try to stack the odds in your favor, and retreat when things seem unfavorable.
- **Planning**
    - Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
    - Do some research, and ask around about your objectives.
- **Ambition**
    - Set goals, and use your meager means to take steps forward.
    - Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
    - Keep things moving forward, and play to see what happens.

## Section 1: Character Creation

### Creating a Character

#### Roll or Choose a Background
- First, roll or choose from the Backgrounds table below and note the page number. You will refer to that page for the next few steps.
- Choose a name from the available list, then record each of your character's starting items. See Inventory and Inventory Slots for how to record items.
- Roll on each of the included tables in the background. Record your character's items, skills, or abilities from each result. Some backgrounds may ask you to refer to the tables in the Marketplace (pg. 16) as well.

#### Attributes, Hit Protection, and Traits
- Roll for your character's Attributes and Hit Protection.
- Roll for the rest of your character's Traits (pg. 10), and then on the Bonds table (pg. 12).
- Finally, roll for your character's Age (2d20+10). If you are the youngest character, roll on the Omens table (pg. 14). The result should be read aloud to the other players. The Warden should incorporate Omens into the setting as they see fit.

#### Backgrounds (d20)
| d20 | Background |
|---|---|
| 1 | Aurifex (pg. 20) |
| 2 | Barber-Surgeon (pg. 22) |
| 3 | Beast Handler (pg. 24) |
| 4 | Bonekeeper (pg. 26) |
| 5 | Cutpurse (pg. 28) |
| 6 | Fieldwarden (pg. 30) |
| 7 | Fletchwind (pg. 32) |
| 8 | Foundling (pg. 34) |
| 9 | Fungal Forager (pg. 36) |
| 10 | Greenwise (pg. 38) |
| 11 | Half Witch (pg. 40) |
| 12 | Hexenbane (pg. 42) |
| 13 | Jongleur (pg. 44) |
| 14 | Kettlewright (pg. 46) |
| 15 | Marchguard (pg. 48) |
| 16 | Mountebank (pg. 50) |
| 17 | Outrider (pg. 52) |
| 18 | Prowler (pg. 54) |
| 19 | Rill Runner (pg. 56) |
| 20 | Scrivener (pg. 58) |

### Attributes
- Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes: **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**.
- Roll 3d6 for each of your character's attributes, in order. You may then swap any two of the results.
- Attributes are not universal descriptors. A character with a low STR is not necessarily hopelessly weak; they can still attempt to lift a heavy door or survive a deadly fight! Their risk is simply higher.

### Hit Protection
- Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection (HP)**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. It does not indicate a character's health or fortitude, nor do they lose it for very long. (See Healing in the Core Rules (pg. 62).)
- If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must reference the Scars table (pg. 66).

### Inventory
- Characters have a total of ten inventory slots but can only carry four items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
- Each PC starts with a **Backpack** that can hold up to six slots of items or Fatigue (pg. 62). **Carts** (which must be pulled with both hands), **Horses**, or **Mules** can make a huge difference in how much a PC can bring with them on an adventure. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment.
- Inventory is abstract, dependent only on the fiction as adjudicated by the Warden. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

#### Inventory Slots
- Most items take up one slot, unless otherwise indicated.
- Petty items do not take up any slots. Bulky items take up two slots.
- A bag of coins worth less than 100gp is petty and does not occupy a slot.

### Bonds (d20)
| d20 | Bond |
|---|---|
| 1 | You inherited a single **Gem** (500gp, cold and brittle) from a long-dead relative. It arrived with a warning: squander your newfound riches, and a debt long thought forgotten would be called in. |
| 2 | A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take **20gp** and a **Strange Compass** (petty) that always points towards something deep in the Wood. |
| 3 | You carry a hand-drawn **Portrait** (petty) of a past love who disappeared into the Wood long ago. Somehow you know that they are still alive. |
| 4 | You found a **Tiny Crystal Prism** (petty) buried in the dirt. When held up to the light, it shows visions of an unknown location deep within the Wood. Sometimes you feel a presence looking back at you. |
| 5 | You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some **Silver Moss** (petty). Swallow it near water, and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt. |
| 6 | You inherited an old **Journal**, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly written from the journal's perspective. The writing is crude but accurate. |
| 7 | You protect a long-dormant family secret. Take one half of an **Ancient Key** (petty). They say that if joined with its twin, it opens a **Gate** through any door. |
| 8 | You received a **Letter** (petty) detailing incontrovertible proof that your true parentage is that of Fae nobility. The note also indicates a date and location where you are to meet the letter's author, deep in the Wood. |
| 9 | You owe a great debt to a member of the nobility and carry their **Signet Ring** (petty), which serves as proof of their protection as well as your obligation. |
| 10 | You consumed a **Mischievous Spirit** that wreaks havoc on your insides, demanding to be taken home, deep in the Wood. It occupies one slot but absorbs one Fatigue each day. It wants you alive (for now). |
| 11 | A roaming storyteller once spun you tales of great treasure hidden deep in the Wood. You thought it naught but fancy, till they gave you a **Rolled-up Map** (petty) marked with an X. |
| 12 | During your travels, you met a dying hunter who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a **Letter** (petty), sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the **Lord of Winter**. |
| 13 | You found a wounded beast in the forest but chose to ignore it. You see it everywhere now, but only when you're alone. It looks sad but not angry. You cannot become panicked when acting alone. |
| 14 | You promised a childhood friend that you'd bring them back a rare gift, something unique in all the world. Take a **Bracelet** (petty) woven from twine and wildflowers. |
| 15 | You crossed a creature of the Wood, and it cursed you with a **Stone Heart**. With each passing month, the stone grows heavier by one slot. Until your debt is lifted, you cannot truly die. |
| 16 | You carved a **Whistle** (petty) from an **Oak Lord's** branch. Your act did not go unnoticed. You cannot seem to rid yourself of the whistle either. |
| 17 | The **Dawn Brigade** did your family a service, giving you a dried **Blood-Red Flower** (petty) as proof. When the flower turns white, it means the favor is owed. |
| 18 | An entertainer once visited your home, filling it with story and song. He left one day without a word, leaving behind only a **Miniature Lute**. Something rattles inside. |
| 19 | A white crow appeared to you in a dream, holding a twig in its mouth. You awoke the next morning with the **Twig** (petty) in your hand. You believe it brings you luck. It smells faintly of sulfur. |
| 20 | One of your ancestors wronged a **Moss Witch**, who cursed their bloodline. Your visage causes mirrors to shatter. You've noticed that the shards can sometimes reveal illusions. |

### Omens (d20)
| d20 | Omen |
|---|---|
| 1 | The once rich waters of a life-giving river have turned black and putrid, tainting the land and sickening those who drink from it. A village elder points to some recent desecration as the cause, but most do not heed their words. |
| 2 | It feels like winter has arrived too quickly this year, frost and snows making their appearance much earlier than expected. There is talk of a pattern to the frost found in windows, ponds, and cracks in the ground. It almost looks like a map. |
| 3 | A thick, unnatural fog has begun encroaching upon an ancient and holy grove. It is said to be the work of a great forest spirit, angered by nearby deforestation. |
| 4 | The night sky grows dimmer each evening, as if stars are disappearing one by one. Rumors of hellish creatures capturing farmers and pulling them into the Roots are spreading like wildfire. Village elders believe the two are connected. |
| 5 | The songbirds of the Wood have fallen eerily silent as of late. Hunters claim that a spectral figure has been spotted wandering the forest, gazing longingly at anyone it encounters. |
| 6 | Strange, tear-shaped stones have been found throughout the region, sparking a "gold rush" of sorts for jewelers and thieves alike. The locals believe they are the tears of the earth itself, weeping for a great tragedy yet to come. |
| 7 | Swarming pests gnaw away at the edges of dreams, and farmers speak of a loud buzzing sound emanating from deep within the Wood. They also say that the sound is getting closer. |
| 8 | There is a village known far and wide for its impressive “mother tree,” said to shelter the town's secrets in its boughs. Recently it has begun bleeding red sap, worrying the elders. |
| 9 | The moon turns a deep crimson, bathing the night in an eerie, blood-red light. Some say it heralds a time of chaos and strife, as the boundaries between the Wood and the mortal realm grow thin. |
| 10 | Strange cracks have appeared in the night sky, revealing a swirling vortex of light and color. Some say that the divide between realms is at its weakest in centuries and fear what may emerge from the other side. |
| 11 | A night-blooming flower once thought extinct is sprouting up throughout the Wood. Its scent is intoxicating but also causes vivid nightmares. |
| 12 | Local livestock have grown increasingly agitated and unmanageable as of late. An old shepherd says it is due to an unsettling howl that emanates from the Wood each full moon. |
| 13 | Swarms of insects are fleeing from the Wood in droves, destroying any wooden structures they come across. The sound of their wings hum a familiar tune as they pass overhead, like a forgotten nursery rhyme. |
| 14 | Hunters talk of a curse that befalls any who kill any beast with a streak of white fur: soon after, they are found dead in their homes. Each day, there are fewer and fewer creatures to hunt. |
| 15 | Folks say that a faint laughter can be heard echoing out of wells all over the city, and that the echoes change to sobs at night. |
| 16 | The constellations have slowly started shifting in the night sky, forming unfamiliar patterns that have stargazers and sages perplexed. Even the animals seem disturbed. |
| 17 | An ancient tree at the heart of a sleepy village has suddenly withered and died, despite showing no signs of disease. After its trunk was cut, a bloody hand was found in its core. |
| 18 | Statues have been weeping blood for months on end, and the wombs of the village have lain barren since. A single child has been the only exception, hidden away by elders overcome with fear and dread. |
| 19 | Local fauna is behaving oddly, displaying heightened aggression or fleeing the area entirely. Hunters talk of a shadowy figure that roams the Wood, calling to the animals. |
| 20 | Border towns have become riotous in recent weeks after multiple claims of a red-robed figure appearing in their children's dreams, uttering the same warning: A fire is coming, and it will consume everything. |

## Section 2: Backgrounds

### 1. Aurifex
*You are an artisan of the arcane, a smith of subtle forces. In the crucible of your workshop, the laws that govern this world are warped to suit your needs.*

**Starting Gear**
- 3d6 Gold Pieces
- Rations (3 uses)
- Lantern
- Oil Can (6 uses)
- Needle-Knife (d6)
- Protective Gloves (petty)

**Names**: Hestia, Basil, Rune, Prism, Ember, Quintess, Aludel, Mordant, Salaman, Jazia

**What experiment went horribly wrong? (d6)**
| d6 | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 | There was an explosion, and you lost your sense of smell. Well, almost: you can sniff out gold as a pig does truffles. Take a **Tin of Snuff** (6 uses) to dampen the impact. Use it every day or become deprived. |
| 2 | You dematerialized a beloved pet. Now it follows you around, invisible but always present. Although it cannot interact with the physical realm, you are able to share its sense. (Add a **Fatigue each time**.) It follows basic commands. |
| 3 | You were exposed to a long-acting truth serum whose effects have yet to wear off. The disorder has its advantages: you cannot repeat lies you've heard, either. |
| 4 | You were adept at creating fake gold, which is almost as good. Eventually, your ruse was discovered, and you had to make a hasty retreat. Take a heavy **Metal Ingot** and **Gold Powder** (3 uses). |
| 5 | Your alchemical recipe worked, but a rival stole the blueprint before your claims could be proven. Take a prototype **Blunderbuss** (d12, blast, bulky) that takes one round to reload, and a taste for revenge. |
| 6 | Ridiculed for discovering how to turn gold into lead, you were a laughing stock. Take a bottle of **Universal Solvent** (2 uses) that dissolves anything it touches into its constituent parts. |

**What alchemical marvel is the product of your latest ingenuity? (d6)**
| d6 | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Pyrophoric Gel**: A sticky green fluid that catches fire when exposed to air, then burns for 8 hours. Cannot be extinguished (1 use). |
| 2 | **Blast Sphere**: A head-sized iron ball filled with explosive powder that explodes on impact (d12, blast, bulky, 1 use). |
| 3 | **Aqua Vita**: Purifies any liquid, converting it to pure water. Drinking it cures 1d6 STR (1 use). |
| 4 | **Mimic Stone**: Records a short phrase that can later be played back. |
| 5 | **Spark Dust**: Ignites easily and quickly. Useful for starting a fire or as an incendiary device (3 uses). |
| 6 | **Homunculus**: A miniature clay replica of yourself that follows your every command. It hates being enthralled to you and complains bitterly whenever possible. Any damage done to the homunculus is also done to you. 3 HP, 4 STR, 13 DEX, 5 WIL |

## Section 3: Core Rules

### Attributes
Each of the three attributes are used in different circumstances. (see Saves.)

- **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, reflexes, dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

### Saves
- A save is a roll to avoid negative outcomes from risky choices. Characters roll a d20 and compare the results to the appropriate attribute. If they roll equal to or under that attribute, they succeed. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.
- If two opponents are each trying to overcome the other, whoever is most at risk should save.
- If two characters need to take an action together, whoever is most at risk should save (usually the character with the lowest relevant Attribute).

### Healing & Recovery
- Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but may leave the party exposed. Bandages can stabilize a character that has taken Critical Damage.
- Attribute loss (see Critical Damage) can usually be restored with a week's rest, facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
- Some healing services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Deprivation & Fatigue
- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is Deprived. Anyone Deprived for more than a day adds Fatigue to their inventory, one for each day. A Deprived PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or item slots from Fatigue.
- A PC may also be forced to add Fatigue after casting spells or due to events occurring in the fiction. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full night's rest in a safe spot).
- If a character is forced to add Fatigue to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

### Armor
- Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's Armor value from the result of damage rolls.
- Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn. Some may also provide additional benefits, depending on the fiction.
- A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armor.

### Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

| 2 | 3-5 | 6-8 | 9-11 | 12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

### Morale
- Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.
- Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP.
- Morale does not affect PCs.

### Hirelings
- Adventuring parties can recruit hirelings, relying on their unique skills, knowledge, and training to aid in expeditions.
- To create a hireling, choose an appropriate role from the Hirelings table in the Marketplace (pg. 16). Roll 3d6 for each attribute and 1d6 for their HP. Give them equipment appropriate to their station, then roll on the Character Traits tables to further flesh them out.
- Alternatively, choose an appropriate background and name from the Character Creation guide. Roll (or choose from) the tables for that background. Then roll for Rations, Gold Pieces, Attributes, HP, and age.

### Die of Fate
- Optionally, roll 1d6 whenever the outcome of an event is uncertain or to simulate an element of randomness and chance.
- A roll of 4 or more generally favors the PCs, while a roll of 3 or under usually means bad luck for the PCs.

### Combat

#### Rounds
- A round is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and proceeds with each side taking turns. Each round starts with all PCs that are able to act, followed by their opponents. The result of each side's actions occur simultaneously.
- During the first round of combat, each PC must make a DEX save in order to act. Special circumstances, abilities, items, or skills may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save lose their turn for this round.
- Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends. The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

#### Actions
- On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be casting a spell, attacking, moving for a second time, or some other reasonable action. Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the Warden calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs.

#### Attacking & Damage
- The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. Attacks in combat automatically hit.
- If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. All actions are declared before being resolved.
- If an attack would take a PC's HP exactly to 0, refer to the Scars table (pg. 66) to see how they are uniquely impacted.

#### Attack Modifiers
- If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is Impaired, and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage regardless of the attack's damage die. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.
- If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is Enhanced, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.
- Attacks with the Blast quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. This can be anything from explosions to a dragon's breath or the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.
- If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result (denoted with a plus symbol, e.g. d8+d8).

### Critical Damage
- Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero is subtracted from their STR by the amount of damage remaining. The target must then immediately make a STR save to avoid taking Critical Damage, using their new STR score. On a success, the target is still in the fight (albeit with a lower STR score) and must continue to make Critical Damage saves when incurring damage.
- Any PC that suffers Critical Damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid (such as bandages), they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour. NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage save are considered dead, per the Warden's discretion. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a Critical Damage save.

### Attribute Loss
- If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious. Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.
- If a PC takes damage outside of combat, they should instead receive damage to an Attribute, typically STR.

### Character Death
- When a character dies, the player should create a new character or take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments
- Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single Detachment. When a detachment takes Critical Damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.
- Attacks against detachments by individuals are Impaired (excluding Blast damage).
- Attacks against individuals by detachments are Enhanced and deal Blast damage.

### Retreat
- Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Ranged Attacks
- Ranged weapons can target any enemy near enough to see the whites of their eyes. Attacks against especially distant targets are Impaired.
- Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.

### Scars
If damage to a PC would reduce their HP to exactly 0, look up the result on the table below based on the amount of HP lost in the attack. For example, if a PC went from 3 HP to 0 HP, they would look at entry #3 (Walloped).

| HP Lost | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 HP | **Lasting Scar**: Roll 1d6 | 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 2 HP | **Rattling Blow**: You're disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 3 HP | **Walloped**: You're sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max HP. |
| 4 HP | **Broken Limb**: Roll 1d6 | 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 5 HP | **Diseased**: You're afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |
| 6 HP | **Reorienting Head Wound**: Roll 1d6 | 1-2: STR, 3-4: DEX, 5-6: WIL. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current attribute, take the new result. |
| 7 HP | **Hamstrung**: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result. |
| 8 HP | **Deafened**: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4. |
| 9 HP | **Re-brained**: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result. |
| 10 HP | **Sundered**: An appendage is torn off, crippled, or useless (the Warden will tell you which.) Then make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6. |
| 11 HP | **Mortal Wound**: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP. |
| 12 HP | **Doomed**: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against Critical Damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

### Magic

#### Spellbooks
- Spellbooks contain a single spell and take up one slot. They cannot be easily transcribed or created; instead they are recovered from places like tombs, dungeons, and manors.
- Spellbooks sometimes display unusual properties or limitations, such as producing a foul or unearthly smell when opened, possessing an innate intelligence, or being legible only when held in moonlight.
- Spellbooks will attract the attention of those who seek the arcane power within, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

#### Casting Spells
- Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and reading its contents aloud. They must then add a Fatigue to inventory.
- Given time and safety, PCs can enhance a spell's impact (e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without any additional cost.
- If the PC is deprived or in danger (such as during combat), the Warden may require a PC to make a WIL save to avoid any ill-effects from casting the spell. Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect and may result in added Fatigue, the destruction of the Spellbook, injury, and even death.

#### Scrolls
Scrolls are similar to Spellbooks, however:
- They are petty.
- They do not cause Fatigue.
- They disappear after one use.

#### Relics
- Relics are items imbued with a magical spell or power. They do not cause Fatigue. Relics usually have limited uses, as well as a Recharge condition.

## Section 4: Procedures

### Dungeon Exploration

#### The Basics
- The dungeon exploration cycle (see below) is divided into a series of Turns, Actions, and their consequences.
- On their Turn, a character can move a distance equal to their torchlight's perimeter (about 40ft) and perform one Action. Players can use their action to move up to three times that distance, though that will increase the chance of triggering a roll on the Dungeon Events table.
- The Warden should present obvious information about an area and its dangers freely and at no cost. Moving quickly or without caution may increase the chance of encountering a wandering monster, springing a trap, or triggering a roll on the Dungeon Events table.

*Although the term “dungeon” is used here, it can mean any dangerous locale (mansions, farmhouses, adventure site, etc.).*

#### Dungeon Exploration Cycle
1. The Warden describes the party's surroundings and any immediate dangers (combat, traps, surprises, etc.). The players then declare their character's intended movements and Actions.
2. The Warden resolves the actions of each character simultaneously, along with any actions that are already in progress. Remember, the Die of Fate can be a useful tool whenever the Warden is in doubt!
3. The players record any loss of resources and any new conditions (i.e. item use, deprivation, etc). The cycle then begins again. If appropriate, the Warden should roll on the Dungeon Events table. Keep common sense in mind when interpreting the results!

#### Dungeon Events
Exploring a dungeon is always dangerous, and time must always be weighed against the risk of awakening the location's denizens, natural hazards, and worse. When the party:
- Spends more than one dungeon cycle in a single room or location.
- Moves quickly or haphazardly through a room.
- Moves into a new area, level, or zone.
- Creates a loud disturbance.

Roll on the table below:

| d6 | Event | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Encounter | Roll on an encounter table. Possibly hostile. (See Reactions (pg. 63).) |
| 2 | Sign | A clue, spoor, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, etc is discovered. |
| 3 | Environment | Surroundings shift or escalate. Water rises, ceilings collapse, a ritual nears completion, etc. |
| 4 | Loss | Torches are blown out, an ongoing spell fizzles, etc. The party must resolve the effects before moving on. |
| 5 | Exhaustion | The party must take a brief rest (roll on this table again), add a Fatigue, or consume a ration. |
| 6 | Quiet | The party is left alone (and safe) for the time being. |

#### Actions
- Actions are any non-passive activities, such as searching for traps, forcing open a door, listening for danger, disarming a trap, engaging an enemy in combat, casting a spell, dodging a trap, running away, resting, etc.
- Some actions have special rules (see below), while others may take multiple turns to complete.
- Loud or noticeable actions may also trigger an encounter with the dungeon's denizens.

#### Searching
- A character can spend a turn performing an exhaustive search of one object or location in an area, revealing any relevant hidden treasure, traps, secret doors, etc.
- Larger rooms and difficult or complex dungeon terrain may take a few turns to properly search.
- Searching a room first is a safer way to explore the dungeon, but it has a steep cost: time.

#### Resting
- A character can spend a turn resting to restore all HP.
- A light source and a safe location are required to rest. Present or oncoming danger makes rest impossible.
- Resting does not restore Fatigue, as it is impossible to safely Make Camp (pg. 79) in a dungeon.

#### Panic
- A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing their greatest fears may experience panic. A WIL save is typically required to avoid losing control and becoming panicked.
- A panicked character must make a WIL save to overcome their condition as an action on their turn.
- A panicked character has 0 HP, does not act in the first round of combat, and all of their attacks are impaired.

### Dungeon Elements

#### Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40ft of dungeon and beyond that only a dim outline of objects. Torches last until they are put out by a character or their environment.
- A torch can be lit 3 times before permanently degrading. A lantern can be relit indefinitely but requires an Oil Can (6 uses).
- Characters without a light source may suffer from panic until their situation is remedied.

#### Doors
- Doors and entryways may be locked, stuck, or blocked entirely. Characters can try to force a door open (or wedge it shut) using available resources (spikes, glue) or through raw ability.
- The party's marching order determines who is most impacted by whatever lies beyond a door.
- A character can detect, through careful observation (listening, smelling, etc.), signs of life and other hazards through nearby doors and walls.

#### Traps
- A cautious character should be presented with any and all information that would allow them the opportunity to avoid springing a trap. An unwitting character will trigger a trap according to the fiction, or will otherwise have a 2-in-6 chance.
- Traps can usually be detected by carefully searching a room.
- Damage from traps is taken from attributes (usually STR or DEX) and not from HP. Armor can reduce damage, but only if applicable (e.g. a shield would not reduce damage from noxious gas).

### Wilderness Exploration

#### Watches
- A day is divided into three watches: morning, afternoon, and night.
- Each character can choose one Wilderness Action (pg. 79) per watch.
- If the characters split up, each group is treated as an independent entity.

#### Points
- Potential destinations on a map are called points.
- One or more watches may be required to journey between two points on a map, depending on the path, terrain, weather, and party status.
- The party should have a rough idea of the challenges involved to get to their destination, but rarely any specifics.

#### Travel Duration
Travel time in Cairn is counted in watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day. However, as most parties elect to spend the third watch of the day resting, one can use “days" as a shorthand for travel time. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to four watches, the party would need to travel for two days, arriving in the evening of the second day.

To determine the distance between two points, combine all penalties from the path, terrain, and Weather Difficulty (pg. 76) tables, taking into account any changes to those elements along the route. For travel via waterways, refer to the surrounding terrain difficulty. For especially vast terrain, assign a penalty of up to +2 watches to the journey.

The weather, terrain, darkness, injured party members, and other obstacles can impact travel or even make it impossible! In some cases, the party may need to add Fatigue or expend resources in order to sustain their pace. Mounts, guides, and maps can increase the party's travel speed or even negate certain penalties.

#### Path Type
| Path | Penalty | Odds of Getting Lost |
|---|---|---|
| Roads | None | None |
| Trails | +1 Watch | 2-in-6 |
| Wilderness | +2 Watches | 3-in-6 |

#### Path Distance
| Distance | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Short | +1 Watch |
| Medium | +2 Watches |
| Long | +3 Watches |

#### Terrain Difficulty
| Difficulty | Terrain | Penalty | Factors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Easy | Plains, plateaus, valleys | None | Safe areas for rest, fellow travelers, good visibility |
| Tough | Forests, deserts, hills | +1 Watch | Wild animals, flooding, broken equipment, falling rocks, unsafe shelters, hunter's traps |
| Perilous | Mountains, jungles, swamps | +2 Watches | Quicksand, sucking mud, choking vines, unclean water, poisonous plants and animals, poor navigation |

#### Weather
Each day, the Warden should roll on the weather table for the appropriate season. If the "Extreme” weather result is rolled twice in a row, the weather turns to "Catastrophic.” A squall becomes a hurricane, a storm floods the valley, etc.

| d6 | Spring | Summer | Fall | Winter |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Nice | Nice | Fair | Fair |
| 2 | Fair | Nice | Fair | Unpleasant |
| 3 | Fair | Fair | Unpleasant | Inclement |
| 4 | Unpleasant | Unpleasant | Inclement | Inclement |
| 5 | Inclement | Inclement | Inclement | Extreme |
| 6 | Extreme | Extreme | Extreme | Extreme |

#### Weather Difficulty
| Weather | Effect | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Nice | Favorable conditions for travel. | Clear skies, sunny |
| Fair | Favorable conditions for travel. | Overcast, breezy |
| Unpleasant | Add a Fatigue or add +1 watch. | Gusting winds, rain showers, sweltering heat, chill air |
| Inclement | Add a Fatigue or add +1 watch. Increase terrain difficulty by a step. | Thunderstorms, lightning, rain, muddy ground |
| Extreme | Add a Fatigue and add +1 watch. Increase terrain difficulty by a step. | Blizzards, freezing winds, flooding, mud slides |
| Catastrophic | Most parties cannot travel under these conditions. | Tornados, tidal waves, hurricane, volcanic eruption |

### Wilderness Elements

#### Night
- The party can choose to travel during the night and rest during the day, but night travel is far slower and more treacherous!
- Traveling at night is always more dangerous! The Warden should roll twice on the Wilderness Events table.
- Some terrain and weather may be easier to traverse at night (desert, for example). The Warden should balance these challenges along with any other.

#### Sleep
- The last watch of the day is typically reserved for the Make Camp (pg. 79) action.
- Characters typically need to sleep each day. Anything beyond a minor interruption can negate or cancel the benefits of sleep.
- If the party skips the Make Camp (pg. 79) action, they each add a Fatigue to their inventory and are deprived. Additionally, traveling when sleep-deprived raises the terrain Difficulty by a step (i.e. Easy becomes Tough).

#### Light
- Torches and other radial sources of light illuminate 40-ft ahead of the party but beyond that only provides a dim outline of objects.
- Characters without a light source may suffer from panic until their situation is remedied.
- Environmental conditions (sudden gusts of wind, dust, water, etc.) can easily blow out a torch.

#### Light Sources
- A torch can be lit 3 times before degrading.
- A lantern can be relit indefinitely but requires a separate Oil Can (6 uses).

### Wilderness Exploration Cycle
1. The Warden describes the current point or region on the map and how the path, weather, terrain, or party status might affect travel speed. The party plots or adjusts a given course towards their destination.
2. Each character chooses a single Wilderness Action (pg. 79). The Warden narrates the results and then rolls on the Wilderness Events table. The party responds to the results.
3. The players and the Warden record any loss of resources and new conditions (i.e. torch use, deprivation, etc), and the cycle repeats.

| d6 | Event | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Encounter | Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type or location. Don't forget to roll for NPC reactions if applicable. |
| 2 | Sign | The party discovers a clue, spoor, or indication of a nearby encounter, locality, hidden feature, or information about a nearby area. |
| 3 | Environment | A shift in weather or terrain. |
| 4 | Loss | The party is faced with a choice that costs them a resource (rations, tools, etc), time, or effort. |
| 5 | Exhaustion | The party encounters a barrier, forcing effort, care or delays. This might mean spending extra time (and an additional Wilderness Action) or adding Fatigue to the PC's inventory to represent their difficulties. |
| 6 | Discovery | The party finds food, treasure, or other useful resources. The Warden can instead choose to reveal the primary feature of the area. |

### Wilderness Actions

#### Travel
- Travel begins. Obvious locations, features, and terrain of nearby areas are revealed according to their distance. This action is typically taken by the entire party as one.
- The party rolls 1d6 to see if they get lost along the way. This risk can increase or decrease, depending on Path Difficulty (pg. 75), maps, party skills, and guides.
- If lost, the party may need to spend a Wilderness Action to recover their way. Otherwise, the party reaches the next point along their route.

*Remember to compare the results of getting lost to the relevant Path Difficulty.*

#### Explore
- One or more party members search a large area, searching for hidden features, scouting ahead, or treading carefully.
- A Location (shelter, village, cave, etc.) or Feature (geyser, underground river, beached ship, etc.) is discovered.
- The Travel action is still required to leave the current area, even if it has been completely explored.

#### Supply
- One or more party members may hunt, fish, or forage for food, collecting 1d4 Rations (3 uses each). The chance of a greater bounty increases with each additional participant (e.g. 1d4 becomes 1d6, up to a maximum of 1d12). Relevant experience or equipment may also increase the bounty.
- The party may encounter homes and small villages, spending gold and a full Watch (pg. 74) to resupply.

#### Make Camp
- The party stops to set up camp in the wilds. Each party member (and their mounts) consumes a Ration.
- A lookout rotation is set so that the party can sleep unmolested. A smaller party may need to risk sleeping unguarded or switch off sleeping over multiple days.
- Party members that were able to rest remove all Fatigue from their inventory.

## Section 5: The Setting of Vald

### Introduction
The implied setting of Cairn is called Vald, encompassing all developed or settled lands, cities, towns, forests, etc. The specific ruler is irrelevant, as most adventures will take place in smaller towns and villages, the forest, and the margins of the realm. Most inhabitants (regardless of region) refer to the local centers of power as the Cities, occasionally as a pejorative.

Towns and villages are built near water and lumber sources, within a day's walk of each other. Larger villages may rely on nearby farms and hunters. Settlements are often organized around specific industries like lumber, brewing, fishing, or mining, with a Fieldwarden or Beast Handler protecting their most valued assets.

Established trails between larger towns are fairly common, while maintained roads are almost non-existent except to the distant cities. Itinerant merchants, Kettlewrights, and various peddlers pass through settlements on a semi-regular basis, sometimes hiring Outriders to protect and escort larger caravans, or Rill Runners to help ferry passengers in the Riverlands.

Even the smallest village may play host to scholarly types from the cities: a Scrivener, Aurifex, or Greenwise with keen interest in nearby tombs, barrows, and Gates. Often a Bonekeeper or Fungal Forager will be hired for their expertise, while clever adventurers will ensure that a Barber-Surgeon is never far away, or a Cutpurse if there is unsavory business that needs tending to. Of course, Mountebanks and Jongleurs often accompany these sorts, riding their coattails in hopes that they too will benefit from the next major discovery.

Those who enter the Wood hire a guide familiar with the territory, such as a Prowler or Fletchwind, while the truly determined traveler will seek the wisdom of a Half Witch or Foundling with some connection to its darker secrets. Closer to the border, the Marchguard work to keep the realm free of outside influence, while the Hexenbane seek to protect it from forces within.

### The Wood
The Wood surrounds and divides the realm, representing not just one forest, but all forests. Denizens of the Wood are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to its rules. Its various peoples, creatures, and unrelenting natural elements have kept the outside world at bay since time immemorial.

At the core of each forest is a Heart Tree, the place where the forest is at its most powerful as well as its most dangerous. Each Heart Tree is born from a single Heartseed, acquired exclusively from a Heart Tree that is dying or dead.

The Wood is populated by creatures strange and wondrous, such as Goblins, Spirits, Treants, Trolls, Werewolves, Witches, and even talking plants and animals. Most are openly hostile to outsiders (particularly humans), but others will (on occasion) parley with those that have shown respect for the Wood. Of course, all demonstrate utter respect for the Fae (sometimes called the Pale Folk, or the Neighbors).

Of course, the Wood is not empty of people. Those who can survive (or even thrive) in such places learn to live according to the rules of the forest, for those who ignore or foolishly oppose these rules often meet grisly ends.

### The Roots
The Roots is a realm of mystery and horror underground, where vast caves loom as large as an emptied ocean, without even a hint of sunlight. The various creatures and wild animals that survive there have developed natural means to live in the utter darkness, adapting their eyesight to function in even the dimmest light or eschewing vision altogether.

Entrances to the Roots, known as Gates, are scattered across the lands and are usually hidden or protected by powerful forces. Once opened, Gates permit dangerous creatures to pass through, giving them free reign over the weak and vulnerable.

Only the brave and foolish enter the Roots, and most do not return. The few that do whisper of the indescribable horrors and evil intelligence guarding these lost treasures. Still, there will always be those who cannot resist the draw of forgotten Relics, profound wealth, or knowledge, for there are rumors that creatures far more interesting than wild beasts make their home in the depths below.
