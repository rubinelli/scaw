# Development Plan: Solo Cairn AI Warden (Critique & Refinement)

> **Original Author:** marcos
> **Revised:** 2025-07-19
> **Critique:** This is a strong, well-structured plan. The primary refinement suggested here is to **prioritize the "Game Management" feature (Task 12)**. This is a foundational architectural change that impacts how the database is accessed. Implementing it *before* other features that interact with the database (like inventory and world generation) will prevent significant refactoring and streamline development.

This revised plan re-orders the tasks for efficiency and renumbers them sequentially for clarity.

# Initial Design
---

## Phase 1: Foundation (The Core MVP)

**Goal:** Implement the minimum viable product. A functional application where a player can create a character within a persistent, named adventure, manage their inventory, and engage in the core gameplay loops.

### **Task 6: Implement Game Log & User Input** [Status: Done]
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [2, 3]
- **Description:** Implement the `GameLogView` to display database entries and the `UserInputBar` to capture player text.

### **Task 7: Implement Simple LLM Service** [Status: Done]
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [1]
- **Description:** Implement the `LLMService` with a single, default provider (Gemini) and test its connectivity.

### **Task 8: Develop Core Warden Orchestrator & Tool-Calling Loop** [Status: Done]
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [5, 6]
- **Description:** Build the core `WardenOrchestrator` to interpret natural language input and use a tool-calling LLM to execute game actions.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **8.1: Create WardenOrchestrator Class:** Define the main class structure.
    - **8.2: Define "World Tools":** Create a set of simple, powerful functions in `src/core/world_tools.py` that represent fundamental game actions (e.g., `roll_dice`, `deal_damage`, `move_character`).
    - **8.3: Implement Tool-Calling Loop:** The orchestrator will pass the player's natural language input and the available "World Tools" to the `LLMService`.
    - **8.4: Implement Tool Execution:** The orchestrator will receive the LLM's chosen tool and arguments, execute the corresponding Python function, and update the game state.
    - **8.5: Synthesize Narrative:** The orchestrator will take the result of the executed tool and use the `LLMService` to generate a narrative description of the outcome for the player.
- **Test Strategy:** Write unit tests for each "World Tool". Write integration tests to verify that natural language commands (e.g., "I attack the goblin") correctly trigger the appropriate tool-calling sequence and state changes.

### **Task 9: Implement Core Combat & Healing Loop** [Status: Done]
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [2, 7]
- **Description:** Implement the fundamental mechanics for combat, healing, and character death.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **9.1: Enhance `GameEntity` Model:** Add `scars` (String) and `is_hostile` (Boolean) fields to the model in `src/database/models.py`.
    - **9.2: Create Database Migration:** Generate and apply a new Alembic migration to update the database schema with the new fields.
    - **9.3: Update `deal_damage` Logic:** Modify the `deal_damage` tool in `src/core/world_tools.py` to handle the "Scar" mechanic when HP hits 0, apply damage to STR only after HP is depleted, and mark entities as `is_retired` at 0 STR without deleting them.
    - **9.4: Implement Healing Tools:** Create a `rest` tool to restore HP to max and a placeholder `make_camp` tool in `src/core/world_tools.py`.
    - **9.5: Implement NPC Reaction Logic:** In `src/core/orchestrator.py`, after a player action, query for hostile NPCs at the location and trigger a counter-attack using the `deal_damage` tool.
    - **9.6: Synthesize Turn Narrative:** Consolidate the results of the player's action and all NPC counter-attacks into a single narrative response using the `LLMService`.
- **Test Strategy:** Create a test scenario with a player and a monster. Verify that using `/attack` correctly reduces the monster's HP and STR, triggers a Scar, and eventually marks it as retired. Test that `rest` restores player HP. Test that a hostile NPC automatically counter-attacks.

---
### **Task 10: Implement Robust Game Management (New, Load, Save)**
- **Priority:** critical
- **Dependencies:** [3]
- **Description:** Refactor the application to support multiple, named adventures instead of a single hardcoded database file. This involves creating a main menu/launcher to manage game slots and abstracting database connections.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **10.1: Abstract Database Path:** Remove the hardcoded `DB_FILE` constant. All database connections will instead use a path stored in Streamlit's session state (e.g., `st.session_state['active_db_path']`).
    - **10.2: Create Adventure Storage:** Establish a dedicated directory (e.g., `scaw/adventures/`) to store all adventure database files (`.db`).
    - **10.3: Implement Game Launcher UI:** Rework the `show_welcome_screen` to act as a full game launcher. It will scan the `adventures/` directory and list all existing `.db` files for the user to choose from.
    - **10.4: Implement "Load Game" Flow:** When a user selects an existing adventure, store its file path in `st.session_state['active_db_path']` and transition to the main game view.
    - **10.5: Implement "New Game" Flow:** The launcher will include a "New Adventure" button and a text input. On creation, it will generate a new, named database file, run the `WorldSeedGenerator` (from Task 11), populate the initial character, and set the new path as the `active_db_path`.
    - **10.6: Implement "Save Game" (Placeholder):** The "Save Game" button will be a placeholder, as all changes are committed directly to the active `.db` file.
- **Test Strategy:** Verify that creating a new game does not overwrite an existing one. Test loading different games sequentially, ensuring the state is correctly isolated.

### **Task 11: Implement World Seed Generator**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [10]
- **Description:** Create the `WorldSeedGenerator` module to pre-generate the entire map graph and save it to the database for a new adventure. This should be called during the "New Game" flow.

### **Task 12: Implement Core Inventory Management**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [3, 5, 8]
- **Description:** Replace the inventory placeholder with a functional UI and the logic to manage items.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **12.1: Create `InventoryView` Component:** Build a UI function to display the character's `Item` records in the sidebar.
    - **12.2: Implement `drop <item>` Handler:** Create the orchestrator logic to handle dropping items.
    - **12.3: Implement `use <item>` Handler:** Create a placeholder handler for using consumable items.
- **Test Strategy:** Create a character with items. Verify they display correctly. Test dropping and using items.

### **Task 13: Implement Basic Map Display**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [4, 11]
- **Description:** Implement the `MapView` to render a non-interactive, informational graph of the world based on the generated seed.

---

## Phase 2: Enrichment (Dynamic World & Player Agency)

**Goal:** Build upon the core loop to make the world feel dynamic and reactive. This phase introduces procedural systems and gives the player more meaningful choices.

---

### **Task 14: Enhance Map System with "Known World" Logic**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [13]
- **Description:** Enhance the `MapView` to handle all four statuses (`hidden`, `rumored`, `known`, `explored`). Implement the logic for discovering locations and paths.

### **Task 15: Implement Procedural Narrative Framework (Oracles)**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [8]
- **Description:** Integrate the Cairn 2E oracles (e.g., Wilderness Events). The `WardenOrchestrator` will trigger these oracles, and the results will be used by the LLM to synthesize narrative.

### **Task 16: Implement Full Character Inventory**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [12]
- **Description:** Implement the full `InventoryView` with its 10-slot grid. Implement the mechanic for when Fatigue forces an item drop.

### **Task 17: Implement Saving Throw Mechanic**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [6, 8]
- **Description:** Implement a "[Click to Roll]" button in the `GameLogView` and the corresponding backend logic to prompt for and resolve saving throws.

### **Task 18: Implement Legacy Play**
- **Priority:** medium
- **Dependencies:** [10]
- **Description:** Add a UI flow for creating a new character within the *currently loaded* adventure after the previous character has been retired.

---

## Phase 3: Immersion (Advanced Features)

**Goal:** Add the final layer of advanced features that create deep immersion, improve AI quality, and provide long-term replayability.

---

### **Task 19: Integrate RAG Context Store (LangChain & ChromaDB)**
- **Priority:** high
- **Dependencies:** [8]
- **Description:** Integrate LangChain and ChromaDB to provide the AI Warden with a long-term, searchable memory of the narrative log, improving context and consistency. The RAG index should be built from the active adventure's database.

### **Task 20: Implement Multi-Provider LLM Service & Settings UI**
- **Priority:** medium
- **Dependencies:** [7]
- **Description:** Extend the `LLMService` to support multiple backends (OpenAI, Gemini, Local). Create a `SettingsView` UI for users to configure their provider and API keys.

### **Task 21: Implement Player Agency Tools (Codex & Oracles)**
- **Priority:** low
- **Dependencies:** [4, 3]
- **Description:** Implement a player-facing `CodexView` for searching discovered lore and an `OraclePanelView` for manual dice rolling.

### **Task 22: Implement Generative Imaging**
- **Priority:** low
- **Dependencies:** [4]
- **Description:** Implement an `ImageGenerationService` and a UI button to allow players to generate images for characters, scenes, or items.

### **Task 23: Implement Post-Generation Parsing**
- **Priority:** medium
- **Dependencies:** [14, 19]
- **Description:** Implement logic for the Warden to parse its own output to identify and act on mechanically significant information (e.g., automatically marking a location as `rumored`).

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Character Creation

**Goal:** Overhaul the character creation process to fully align with the Cairn 2E Player's Guide, providing a dynamic, randomized, and interactive experience for the player.

---

### **Task 24: Data Extraction & Modeling for Character Creation**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Dependencies:** [P1-Task-3]
- **Description:** Extract all character creation tables (Backgrounds, Traits, Bonds, Omens) from `Cairn_2E_Players_Guide.md` and model them as structured data in `src/core/oracles.py`. This will centralize the data for easy access by the generation logic.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **24.1: Model Core Trait Tables:** Create new dictionaries in `oracles.py` for all d10 Trait tables: `PHYSIQUE`, `SKIN`, `HAIR`, `FACE`, `SPEECH`, `CLOTHING`, `VIRTUE`, and `VICE`.
    - **24.2: Model Bonds and Omens:** Create new d20 dictionaries in `oracles.py` for `BONDS` and `OMENS`.
    - **24.3: Model Backgrounds:** Create a comprehensive `BACKGROUNDS` dictionary in `oracles.py`. Each of the 20 backgrounds will be a key, and its value will be a dictionary containing its starting gear, a list of names, and its unique sub-tables for random generation.
- **Test Strategy:** N/A (This is primarily a data entry and modeling task).

### **Task 25: Develop Character Generation Service**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Dependencies:** [24]
- **Description:** Create a `CharacterGenerator` service in a new file, `src/core/character_generator.py`. This service will encapsulate all the logic for creating a complete, randomized character according to the rules, without directly interacting with the UI or database.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **25.1: Implement the `CharacterGenerator` Class:** This class will use the newly modeled oracle tables.
    - **25.2: Create `generate_character()` Method:** This core method will perform all the necessary rolls:
        - Roll 3d6 for STR, DEX, and WIL.
        - Roll 1d6 for HP.
        - Roll on all Trait, Bond, and Omen tables.
        - Roll for Age (2d20+10).
        - Randomly select a Background and process its specific tables for starting gear and abilities.
        - Return a single, structured "character sheet" object containing all the generated data.
- **Test Strategy:** Write unit tests for the `CharacterGenerator` service. Verify that the generated character object contains all required fields (stats, traits, items, etc.) and that the attribute and HP values fall within their expected ranges (e.g., STR between 3 and 18).

### **Task 26: Implement Interactive Character Creation UI**
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** [25]
- **Description:** Create a new UI screen, defined in `src/ui/character_creation_view.py`, that allows the player to generate and re-roll a character until they are satisfied.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **26.1: Create the `render_character_creation_view` function:** This function will manage the layout of the new screen.
    - **26.2: Design the Character Sheet Display:** The UI will clearly present all the generated character information: name, attributes, HP, traits, bond, omen, and the complete list of starting items and abilities from their background. This data will be temporarily stored in `st.session_state`.
    - **26.3: Implement "Generate / Re-roll" Button:** This button will call the `CharacterGenerator` service to create a new character sheet and update the display.
    - **26.4: Implement "Accept & Begin" Button:** This button will finalize the character creation process, triggering the logic to save the character to the database.
- **Test Strategy:** Manual UI testing to ensure the character sheet displays correctly and that the "Re-roll" functionality works as expected.

### **Task 27: Integrate New Creation Flow into Application**
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** [26]
- **Description:** Update the main application logic in `src/app.py` to direct the user to the new character creation screen after starting a new adventure.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **27.1: Modify the "New Game" Flow:** In the `show_launcher()` function, after a new adventure database is created, set a session state flag (e.g., `st.session_state['character_creation_active'] = True`) to signal that character creation should begin.
    - **27.2: Update Application Router:** In the `main()` function, add logic to check for the `character_creation_active` flag and call `render_character_creation_view()` when it is true.
    - **27.3: Implement Character Persistence:** The "Accept & Begin" button in the new UI will be responsible for taking the character data from session state, creating the `GameEntity` and associated `Item` records in the database, and then transitioning the application to the main game view.
- **Test Strategy:** Conduct an end-to-end test of the complete "New Game" -> "Create Character" -> "Begin Adventure" user flow to ensure seamless integration.

---

## Future Considerations

Items from the PRD's "Out of Scope" section will be considered after the completion of these three phases.
- Multiplayer functionality.
- VTT Integration.
- Mobile/Responsive UI.
- Support for third-party supplements.

---

## Phase 5: Generative World Enrichment

**Goal:** Overhaul the world generation process to create richer, more detailed, and narratively compelling environments. This involves using the LLM to expand simple points of interest into multi-location areas with evocative descriptions and populated contents.

---

### **Task 28: Enhance Database for Richer World Data**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Dependencies:** [3]
- **Description:** Modify the database schema to support more detailed and LLM-generated world information.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **28.1: Add `summary` to `MapPoint`:** Add a `summary` text field to the `MapPoint` model to store an LLM-generated overview of the area.
    - **28.2: Add `is_entry_point` to `Location`:** Add an `is_entry_point` boolean field to the `Location` model to designate it as the primary entry, replacing the old `default_location` foreign key.
    - **28.3: Create Database Migration:** Generate and apply a new Alembic migration for these schema changes.

### **Task 29: Overhaul World Generator for LLM-driven Enrichment**
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Dependencies:** [7, 11, 28]
- **Description:** Refactor the `WorldGenerator` to use the `LLMService` to transform basic procedural outputs into rich, multi-location points of interest.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **29.1: Inject `LLMService`:** The `WorldGenerator` will be initialized with an `LLMService` instance.
    - **29.2: Implement Two-Phase Generation:** The process will be split. First, generate the mechanical details of a `MapPoint` (type, name). Second, use a new method to enrich it.
    - **29.3: Create `_enrich_map_point_with_llm` Method:** This new private method will construct a detailed prompt asking the LLM to act as a game master. The LLM will return a JSON object containing a `summary` for the `MapPoint`, a list of 2-4 interconnected `Locations` (with `name`, `description`, and suggested `contents`), and a simple connection map.
    - **29.4: Implement LLM Output Processing:** The `WorldGenerator` will parse the LLM's JSON response to create the `Location` and `LocationConnection` records in the database, populating them with the generated descriptions and contents (as `GameEntity` or `Item` records). One location will be marked as the `is_entry_point`.

### **Task 30: Adapt Application to New World Structure**
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** [8, 29]
- **Description:** Update other parts of the application to correctly use the new, richer world structure.
- **Subtasks:**
    - **30.1: Update Orchestrator:** Modify the `WardenOrchestrator` to use the `MapPoint.summary` for context and to place new characters at the `Location` marked `is_entry_point` within the starting `MapPoint`.
    - **30.2: Adjust Character Placement:** Ensure the new character flow correctly identifies and uses the `is_entry_point` location when a new game begins.

Phase 1: Core Gameplay Loop (Completed)

[x] Implement basic character creation.
[x] Implement inventory and item management.
[x] Implement basic combat mechanics.
[x] Implement basic world generation.
[x] Implement basic AI for non-player characters.

Phase 2: Foundational Enrichment (Low-Hanging Fruit)

Goal: Immediately improve the game's "feel" with high-impact, low-complexity changes that enrich the
existing world without major architectural overhauls.

---

Task 1: Enhance LLM Persona & Sensory Details
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: [Phase 1]
- Description: Refine the AI Warden's narrative voice and make locations more immersive by adding a layer
    of consistent, ambient sensory information.
- Subtasks:
    - 1.1: Refine Warden's Core Prompt: Systematically review and rewrite the base prompts sent to the
        LLMService. The new prompts will instruct the AI to adopt a more descriptive, "storyteller" persona,
        focusing on sensory details, NPC body language, and tone.
    - 1.2: Enhance `Location` Data Model: Add ambient_sounds (JSON/Text) and ambient_smells (JSON/Text)
        fields to the Location model in src/database/models.py.
    - 1.3: Create Database Migration: Generate and apply a new Alembic migration to update the database
        schema.
    - 1.4: Update `WorldGenerator`: During the _enrich_map_point_with_llm step, add instructions to the
        prompt to generate and return appropriate ambient sounds and smells for each location.
    - 1.5: Integrate into Orchestrator: The WardenOrchestrator will fetch these new details for the
        player's current location and include them in the context provided to the LLMService for all
        narrative generation, ensuring a consistent atmosphere.
- Test Strategy: Manual UI testing. Verify that the Warden's descriptions are noticeably richer and that
    ambient details are consistently woven into the narrative for different locations.

---

Phase 3: Narrative Direction & Player Onboarding

Goal: Provide the player with clear starting points and motivations, transforming the sandbox into a world
with actionable hooks and a sense of purpose from the beginning.

---

Task 2: Implement Populated Starting Hub
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: [Task 1]
- Description: Ensure every new adventure begins in a central, populated settlement, giving the player a
    safe place to start and a cast of NPCs to interact with.
- Subtasks:
    - 2.1: Refine `WorldGenerator` Logic: Modify the world generation process to guarantee that the first
        MapPoint is always a "Settlement" type (e.g., Village, Town, Outpost).
    - 2.2: Populate the Hub: As part of settlement generation, create and place several non-hostile NPCs
        (GameEntity records) within its various Locations (e.g., a blacksmith in the smithy, a bartender in
        the tavern). These NPCs should be given simple, descriptive backstories.
    - 2.3: Adjust Character Placement: Update the "New Game" flow to ensure the player character is always
        placed at the designated is_entry_point of the starting settlement.
- Test Strategy: Create several new adventures. Verify that each one starts in a location that is clearly a
    settlement and is populated with at least 3-4 interactable, non-hostile NPCs.

Task 3: Implement Omen-Driven Quest System
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: [Task 2]
- Description: Create a simple quest system where a character's starting Omen provides the initial hook for
    their first major adventure, giving immediate direction.
- Subtasks:
    - 3.1: Create `Quest` Data Model: Add a new Quest table to src/database/models.py with fields like id,
        title, description, status ('active', 'completed'), source_omen (Text), and owner_entity_id (FK to
        GameEntity).
    - 3.2: Create Database Migration: Generate and apply a new Alembic migration for the Quest table.
    - 3.3: Create `QuestManager` Service: In the core logic, create a new service responsible for creating,
        updating, and retrieving quests from the database.
    - 3.4: Link Omens to Quests: In the CharacterGenerator, after a character's Omen is determined, use the
        QuestManager to create a corresponding "starter quest." The details of the quest should be generated
        by the LLM based on the Omen's text. For example, the Omen "Revenge" might generate a quest to hunt
        down the bandits who wronged the character's family.
    - 3.5: Implement Quest Log UI: Create a render_quest_log function in the ui module and add it to the
        sidebar as an st.expander. This will display all 'active' and 'completed' quests for the player.
- Test Strategy: Unit test the QuestManager. Conduct an end-to-end test: create a new character, verify
    their Omen generates a relevant quest, and confirm it appears correctly in the new Quest Log UI.

---

Phase 4: Dynamic World Systems

Goal: Introduce systems that allow the world to change and react over time, both randomly and in response to
underlying political and social structures.

---

Task 4: Implement Factions & World Politics
- Priority: Medium
- Dependencies: [Task 3]
- Description: Establish a foundation for emergent narrative by creating competing factions that influence
    the world.
- Subtasks:
    - 4.1: Create `Faction` Data Model: Add a Faction table to the database with id, name, description, and
        goals. Add a nullable faction_id foreign key to the GameEntity model.
    - 4.2: Create Database Migration: Generate and apply the necessary migration.
    - 4.3: Integrate into `WorldGenerator`: During world generation, create 2-3 unique factions. Assign key
        NPCs generated in the Starting Hub and other locations to these factions.
    - 4.4: Expose Faction Info: Update the CodexView to include an entry for discovered factions and their
        known members.
- Test Strategy: Inspect the database after world generation to confirm that factions are created and NPCs
    are correctly assigned to them.

Task 5: Implement Dynamic Event System
- Priority: Medium
- Dependencies: [Task 4]
- Description: Make the world feel less static by creating an engine that triggers events based on player
    actions, location, and the state of the world's factions.
- Subtasks:
    - 5.1: Create `EventEngine` Service: Develop a new service in the core logic.
    - 5.2: Define Event Triggers: The WardenOrchestrator will call the EventEngine at key moments (e.g.,
        when the player rests, travels between map points, or completes a quest).
    - 5.3: Implement Event Sources: The EventEngine will have logic to:
        - Roll on Cairn's oracle tables for random encounters or environmental events.
        - Generate faction-based events (e.g., an encounter with a faction patrol, discovery of a note from
            a competing faction).
    - 5.4: Integrate with Orchestrator: The result of an event (e.g., spawning a hostile creature,
        revealing a rumored location) will be executed by the orchestrator, which then narrates the outcome.
- Test Strategy: Write unit tests for different event triggers. Manually test travel and resting to ensure
    events are firing at an appropriate rate and are narratively consistent.

---

Phase 5: Polish & Future-Proofing

Goal: Refine the user experience and consolidate the new features, while formally acknowledging more
advanced concepts for future development cycles.

---

Task 6: UI/UX Refinements
- Priority: Low
- Dependencies: [Task 3]
- Description: Improve the overall usability and visual appeal of the application based on the new
    features.
- Subtasks:
    - 6.1: Redesign Character Sheet: Make it more visually appealing and easier to read.
    - 6.2: Improve Inventory Management: Add clearer visual cues for item slots and encumbrance.
    - 6.3: Enhance Feedback Mechanisms: Ensure that quest updates, event triggers, and other system-driven
        changes are clearly communicated to the player in the game log.

Task 7: Add to Future Considerations
- Priority: Low
- Dependencies: N/A
- Description: Formally document the "Living World" simulation concept in the PRD's "Out of Scope" section
    to capture it for potential future development. This acknowledges the idea of NPCs having schedules and
    factions pursuing goals independently, while clarifying it is not part of the current development push.
