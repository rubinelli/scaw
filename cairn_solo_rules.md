# **Cairn Solo Rules**

A complete guide to playing Cairn Second Edition without a Warden, fully integrating the procedures and tables from the *Warden's Guide* to generate a mythic, whimsical, and dangerous world.

---

### **0. Before You Begin: Seeding Your World**

Before your first session, you can create a unique region to explore. This process uses the world-building tools in the *Warden's Guide (WG)*. You can do this once, or repeat it whenever you want to expand your known world.

1.  **Establish the Region Theme (WG p.7):** Roll on the **Culture** and **Resources** tables to define the people of the region and what they value. This gives you a thematic filter for all future results.
2.  **Generate the Topography (WG p.14-17):** Use the "Die Drop" method to create your region map. Roll 1d6 to determine the number of terrain dice to roll. For each die, use its result on the **Terrain Die Drop Table** and roll on the corresponding table (Easy, Tough, or Perilous) to get a terrain type and a landmark.
3.  **Establish Factions (WG p.8-13):** A region should have 1-3 major factions. Use the **Faction Type, Faction Traits, Faction Advantages,** and **Faction Agendas** tables to create them. Give them a name using the **Faction Names** table (WG p.120). These factions are now "active" in the world.
4.  **Place Points of Interest (WG p.21-27):** Use the "Die Drop" method to populate your map with 3-8 POIs. Roll d6 for each die and consult the **POI Die Drop Table**. Then, roll on the appropriate table (Settlements, Waypoints, Curiosities, Lairs, Dungeons) to give each one a unique identity. Name them using the **Naming Procedures** (WG p.116).
5.  **Draw Paths (WG p.28-29):** Connect your POIs with paths. Decide if they are roads, trails, or wilderness routes. Roll on the **Path Features** table for flavor and use the **Terrain Difficulty** table to determine travel times between nodes.

> **Designer's Note:** This pre-play setup creates a rich sandbox to explore. Alternatively, you can generate the world as you go using the **Pointcrawl Generation** procedure in **Annex A**.

### **1. The Core Loop**

Solo play follows a simple loop for each scene:
1.  **Set the Scene:** Frame the current situation. Where are you? What are you trying to accomplish?
2.  **Ask Questions, Get Answers:** Use the Oracles (Section 2) to resolve uncertainties and reveal the world.
3.  **Act & Resolve:** Decide your character's actions. Use the core *Cairn* rules for risky actions.
4.  **Update the World:** Log the outcome, discoveries, and new details in your journal.
5.  **Advance Time:** Track resources and time. Use the appropriate exploration procedure (Section 3).

---

### **2. The Oracles**

#### **The Fate Oracle (Yes/No)**
Ask a yes/no question and roll a d6.
| d6 Roll | Result | Interpretation |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| 1 | **No, and...** | A complication occurs. Use the Spark Oracle if needed. |
| 2-3 | **No.** | The answer is no. |
| 4-5 | **Yes.** | The answer is yes. |
| 6 | **Yes, and...** | An advantage is revealed. Use the Spark Oracle if needed. |
**Adjust for Likelihood:** Roll 2d6 and take highest for **Likely**, lowest for **Unlikely**.

#### **The Spark Oracle**
When you need a quick, abstract idea, roll d20 on each table and combine them.
| d20 | Action | d20 | Focus |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| 1 | Transform | 1 | A fey bargain |
| ... | *(table unchanged)* | ... | *(table unchanged)* |
| 20| Transcend | 20 | A shifting doorway |

### **3. Exploration Procedures**

#### **Wilderness Travel (Watch by Watch)**
For each watch spent traveling between POIs on your map:
1.  **Consume Resources:** Mark off one ration per character.
2.  **Determine the Outcome:** Roll **1d12** on the **Wilderness Events** table.

**Wilderness Events (d12)**
| d12 | Event |
|:----|:---|
| 1 | **Encounter (Hostile):** Use **Encounter Generator (Sec 4)**. The entity is immediately hostile.
| 2-3 | **Encounter (Wary):** Use **Encounter Generator (Sec 4)**. Disposition is uncertain.
| 4-5 | **Sign of a Nearby Threat:** Evidence of a creature from the Bestiary or a hostile Faction.
| 6 | **Sign of a Nearby Location:** A clue (map, signpost) points to a hidden location. Add a new POI to your map.
| 7-8 | **Landmark or Feature:** A non-hostile, interesting feature. Use tables from **WG p.16-17** for inspiration.
| 9-10 | **Hazard:** An obstacle blocks your path. Use the **Path Features** table for inspiration (WG p.29).
| 11 | **Weather Event:** Roll on the **Seasonal Weather** table (WG p.18). If the result is extreme, also roll on **Unusual Weather** (WG p.19).
| 12 | **Faction Event:** One of the Factions you created makes a move. Roll on the **Faction Actions** table (WG p.13). Update the world state.

#### **Site Exploration (Dungeon Delving)**
When exploring a dangerous site (Lair, Ruin, Dungeon), time is measured in **Turns** (approx. 10 mins). An **Encounter Check (1-in-6)** is made each Turn you do something loud or time-consuming.
1.  **Enter New Area:** Roll on the **Dungeon Die Drop Table (WG p.42)** to determine the room type.
2.  **Stock the Room:** Roll on the appropriate table for that room type: **Monster (p.44), Lore (p.45), Special (p.46),** or **Trap (p.47)**.
3.  **Describe:** Use the dungeon's theme (see **Annex B**) and your generative rolls to describe the area.
4.  **Interact:** Declare your actions. If they take time/make noise, make an Encounter Check. Wandering monsters are typically from the Bestiary or based on the dungeon's denizens.

---

### **4. Encounter Generator**

When an encounter is indicated:
1.  **Check the Bestiary (WG p.82-105):** Is there a creature that fits the terrain and situation? If so, use it. The world feels more real if you meet its established inhabitants.
2.  **Create a Monster (WG p.106-110):** If nothing in the Bestiary fits, or you want something unique, use the full **Creating Monsters** procedure. Roll on the **Appearance, Traits, Attacks,** and **Abilities** tables.
3.  **Generate an NPC/Faction:** For a simple traveler, use the **NPC Generator** below. For a more significant character, they are likely an **Agent** of one of your established Factions. Determine their goal based on their Faction's **Agenda**.

**Simple NPC Generator**
*   **Disposition (d6):** 1. Hostile, 2-3. Wary, 4. Neutral, 5. Curious, 6. Friendly.
*   **Goal (d6):** 1. To protect a secret, 2. Find a lost item, 3. Serve a higher power, 4. Gain wealth/status, 5. Escape their past, 6. Understand a mystery.
*   **Quirk:** Roll on the **Quirk** table (WG p.186).

### **5. Downtime**

When in a safe settlement, you can perform downtime activities. After your other activities, perform a **Faction Turn**.

*   **Rest & Recover:** Heal HP and remove deprivation.
*   **Trade & Resupply:** Buy and sell goods.
*   **Research:** Use the Oracles to investigate clues.
*   **Carouse:** Ask the Oracle "What rumor do I hear?".
*   **Journal:** Update your log, reflect, and plan your next move.
*   **Faction Turn:** For each major Faction in the region, roll a **d6** on the **Faction Actions** table (WG p.13) unless the fiction suggests they wouldn't be acting right now. On a 1, a new **Obstacle** is introduced. On a 6, a new **Advantage** is found. Update your understanding of the world based on the result.

---
### **Annex A: Pointcrawl Generation (On-the-Fly)**
Use this if you prefer to generate the world as you go, rather than doing the World-Building step upfront.
1.  **Start Point:** Place your starting location on a blank page. This is your first **Node**.
2.  **Determine Paths:** From this new node, determine how many unknown paths lead away from it. Roll **1d6**: 1: Dead End; 2-4: One new path; 5: Two new paths; 6: Junction (1d4+1 new paths).
3.  **Define a Path:** When traveling an unknown path, roll on the **Path Features** table (WG p.29). Determine travel time using the **Terrain Difficulty** table (WG p.29). A short path is 1 watch, medium is 2, long is 3. Add penalties for terrain.
4.  **Discover New Node:** At the end of a path is a new Node. Roll on the **POI Die Drop Table (WG p.21)** to determine its type, then roll on the relevant sub-table to detail it.
5.  **Expand the Map:** Repeat this procedure from any new node to grow the map organically.

### **Annex B: Dungeon Seeding**
When you discover a Dungeon POI, you can give it a rich history and theme before exploring it room-by-room. Use the tables from the *Warden's Guide*.
1.  **History (WG p.35):** Roll on the **Purpose** table to determine who built it and why.
2.  **Construction (WG p.36):** Roll on the **Entrance** and **Composition** tables.
3.  **Ruination (WG p.37):** Roll on the **Condition** and **Cause** tables to see what befell it.
4.  **Denizens (WG p.38-40):** Roll on the **Denizen Traits** and **Dungeon Factions** tables to define the current inhabitants and their goals. This theme will now color all of your **Site Exploration** rolls.
